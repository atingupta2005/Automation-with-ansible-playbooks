 - It's the configuration, deployment and orchestration language of Ansible and it's expressed in YAML format
 - Structure of the Playbook

 - hosts: all
   become: yes
   tasks:
   - yum: name=wget state=absent
   - yum: name=vim state=present
```
 - Sample playbook - install_httpd.yml
```
---
 - hosts: web
   become: yes
   tasks:
   - yum: name=httpd state=present
```
